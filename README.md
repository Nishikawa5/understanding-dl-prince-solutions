# Understanding Deep Learning: Book Review

[Simon Prince's "Understanding Deep Learning"](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) is a really good introduction to the field of deep learning. The book follows a clear progression, starting with a brief explanation of machine learning basics, moving through linear regression models, then covering the fundamentals of deep learning before advancing to current state-of-the-art models.

## Accessibility

The book maintains reasonable prerequisites, assuming only basic knowledge of probability, calculus, and linear algebra. The mathematical treatment is notably less intensive than other texts in the field, such as [Christopher Bishop's "Deep Learning Foundations,"](https://www.bishopbook.com) or [Ian Goodfellow's "Deep Learning,"](https://www.deeplearningbook.org) making it more accessible to newcomers.

## Approach and Limitations

While the book excels as an introductory resource, it doesn't delve deeply into implementing models with real data in notebooks, focusing more on conceptual understanding than hands-on practice. However, you can supplement it with other resources like [public university assignments](https://github.com/Nishikawa5/awesome-deeplearning-university-assignments) and [Zachary Lipton's "Dive Into Deep Learning,"](https://d2l.ai) while reading.

Some chapters, particularly those covering diffusion models and reinforcement learning, present equations without providing substantial insight. These sections feel somewhat superficial, but at this point you can pick some other resource like [Understanding Diffusion Models: A Unified Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11970) and [Stanford Reinforcement Learning Course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/) to learn these topics.

## Overall Assessment

Despite these limitations, "Understanding Deep Learning" serves as an outstanding resource for newcomers to the field. Its free availability further enhances its value for anyone seeking to enter deep learning.

The book succeeds in its primary objective: providing an accessible introduction to deep learning concepts without overwhelming readers with excessive mathematical complexity or too much implementation details.
